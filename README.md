**Build, test, and deploy robust microservices JavaScript**

## What is this book about?
Microservices enable us to develop software in small pieces that work together but can be developed separately; this is one reason why enterprises have started embracing them. For the past few years, Node.js has emerged as a strong candidate for developing microservices because of its ability to increase your productivity and the performance of your applications.

This book covers the following exciting features: 
* Learn microservice concepts
* Explore different service architectures, such as Hydra and Seneca
* Understand how to use containers and the process of testing
* Use Docker and Swarm for continuous deployment and scaling
* Learn how to geographically spread your microservices
